# Automating Evaluations.

This isn't finished yet.

Economists love talking about evaluations. They especially love talking about how we need more and better evaluations. This is often felt to require more money to pay economists.

There is less talk about how we might make evaluations more efficient, and yet the scope for that is large and growing.

Today good evaluations of economic interventions in the UK tend to require lots of private data, often securely held by the UK government, and accessed with large restrictions, only after a long delay. Economies of scale are lost, reproducibility is limited, agile working is impossible when the timescales for safe data release are measured in months not minutes.

There is a better way, which we will explore through three examples.

## 1. MediaCity: The economic impact of the BBC's move to Salford Quays.

Using firm level data, considering displacement, defining the relevant sector, controlling for the counterfactual (growth in other cities). Swinney, Forth, Overman, Nathan. 

## 2. Brexit: The economic impact of leaving the EU.

The creation of synthetic controls by Springford.

## 3. Small business loans.

SQW evaluation for the British Business Bank.

## Automating evaluations using The Data City's unique, and uniquely accessible data.
