# Automating Evaluations.

This isn't finished yet.

Economists love talking about evaluations. They especially love talking about how we need more and better evaluations. This is often felt to require more money to pay economists.

There is less talk about how we might make evaluations more efficient, and yet the scope for that is large and growing.

Today good evaluations of economic interventions in the UK tend to require lots of private data, often securely held by the UK government, and accessed with large restrictions only after a long delay. Economies of scale are lost, reproducibility is limited, agile working is impossible when the timescales for safe data release are measured in months not minutes.

There is a better way, which we will explore through three examples.

## 1. MediaCity: The economic impact of the BBC's move to Salford Quays.

In 2011 The BBC started moving some of its staff from London to Salford Quays in Greater Manchester. One of the reasons for the move was to [create jobs in Greater Manchester beyond those that directly moved](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/10143-001_The-BBCs-move-to-Salford.pdf). Did this happen?

In 2017, [Paul Swinney at Centre for Cities made a first effort to judge that](https://www.centreforcities.org/reader/move-public-sector-jobs-london/relocation-bbc-activities-salford/). He was sceptical. Using firm level data via the [Business Structure Database](https://www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk/our-work/data-sources/business-structure-database/) on businesses in economic sectors related to the BBC and considering displacement he showed that far fewer jobs than hoped had yet been created. defining the relevant sector, controlling for the counterfactual (growth in other cities).

## Automating evaluations using The Data City's unique, and uniquely accessible data.

These examples of evaluations of economic impact require a number of
