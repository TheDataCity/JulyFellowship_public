# The Data City Data Science Fellowship 1, July 2025.

Getting and keeping an academic job is hard. Many more PhDs graduate each year than there are positions in the research and teaching pipeline. People looking to start their careers in STEM fields are anxious about their prospects. Graduate [wage premiums are falling in every UK region except London](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp198), even in STEM fields.

At the same time, data science and AI companies complain about skills shortages as a constraint on their expansion. In a country which hasn't seen much economic growth for two decades that expansion is desperately needed.

If both the early career STEM graduates and the companies' claims are right, then something is going wrong with how we match skilled people with great jobs. As a company that creates great jobs in STEM fields, we see an opportunity.

## Faculty fellowship.

At [Open Data Camp in Manchester in July 2024](https://www.odcamp.uk/open-data-camp-9-manchester-6-7-july-2024/) we had the good fortune to meet [Luke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukessmead/) and [Lilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilly-reppin-4b5219173/) from Faculty AI, one of the UK's larger and fastest growing employers of STEM graduates in Data Science and AI. Luke and Lilly were fantastic adverts for Faculty and advocates of the [Faculty Fellowship](https://faculty.ai/fellowship-fellows) process that helped them transition from academia to industry. 

If you want to learn more about the Faculty Fellowship, you could do much worse than listening to [Marc Warner's episode of the Anglofuturism podcast](https://anglofuturism.substack.com/p/ai-state-capacity-and-britains-technological-future). If you want to apply and you fancy living in or moving to London, [there's a good website](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/faculty/d11a1af5-b77c-4904-892a-5937fe9ccd10).

But what if you're in or near Leeds?

## The Data City fellowship.

We're hoping the answer will soon be to join us.

We're trying out a fellowship scheme.

It's fixed term, lasts eight weeks, and is paid Â£38k/year. You'll work on a real problem, either developing a new product feature within our business, or delivering a project for a paying client. You'll get a great laptop and be embedded in a great team in a great office in central Leeds doing that.

At the end of the fellowship you'll present your work to our client, internal or external, and probably publish it on the web. Then we'll discuss whether you're interested in staying with us, and whether we can make you a job to stay in.

Our first fellow [Danielle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-bullamore/) started on the 30th of June. She's just submitted her PhD in Fluid Dynamics to the University of Leeds and is with us while she waits for it to be examined.

She'll tell you how she found things in eight weeks. And then based on that experience, and our experience, we'll decide how we need to tweak our fellowship to make it even better, and how big and how soon the next round of it will be.
